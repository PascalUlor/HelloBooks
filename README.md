## Models

Three models are defined: `Users`, `Books` and `UserBooks`. `Book` must have a unique title and title  on their creation. A `User` can borrow a book `Book`. The routes are defined under `models/index`.

## Testing

Server side testing is achieved through use of `chai-http`, `mocha` and `chai` packages. `chai-http` is used to make requests to the api and `mocha` is the testing framework and `chai` is the exception library. They will both be installed when you run `npm install` and the tests will run when you run `npm test`.

Client side testing is achieved through the use of `jest` package. `jest` is used to test javascript code in
React applications.

## Express Routes

Api endpoints were created using `express` router. The routes are defined under `server/routes`.
